# Good practices

##### Naming a commit
Depends mainly from company to company. Some companies likes to commit in present sentences, another ones in past sentences.

# Commands


| Task                            | Git command  |
| ------------------------------- | ------------ |
| initialize a repository         | `git init`   |
| add changes to the staging area | `git add`    |
| commit the changes              | `git commit` |
| status of the repository        | `git status` |
| read the commit history         | `git log`    |
| push changes to remote repo     | `git push`   |
| pull commits from remote repo   | `git pull`   |


Just type `git` in the terminal to get the main commands.

# Config

To know which user I am using. This name is only to show people who did the changes. Not necessarily the user of github.

`git config user.name`

Same for email

`git config user.email`

# Branching


| Task                              | Command                           |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| go to a specific commit           | `git checkout *commit-id*`        |
| to know in which branch are we at | `git branch`                      |
| to create a new branch            | `git checkout -b *branch-name*`   |
| to switch to another branch       | `git switch *name-of-the-branch*` |
| to rename a branch                | `git branch -m *new-name*`        |
| basic git visualization           | `gitk`                            |
| git log with less info            | `git log --oneline`                                  |
