# Good practices

##### Naming a commit
Depends mainly from company to company. Some companies likes to commit in present sentences, another ones in past sentences.

# Commands


| Task                            | Git command  |
| ------------------------------- | ------------ |
| initialize a repository         | git init     |
| add changes to the staging area | git add      |
| commit the changes              | git commit             |
| status of the repository        | `git status` |
| read the commit history         | `git log`    |
|                                 |              |


Just type `git` in the terminal to get the main commands.

# Config

To know which user I am using. This name is only to show people who did the changes. Not necessarily the user of github.

`git config user.name`

Same for email

`git config user.email`

# Fork
